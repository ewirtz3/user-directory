# React Employee Directory

## Description

This is a React-based application that serves as an Employee Directory. Using class and functional React components, the page renders 200 employee info cards using an AJAX call via axios. The list may be sorted alphabetically or filtered by birth month via buttons.

## Usage

This app would be particularly helpful for HR employees. Currently, they would be able to see which office birthdays are coming up next month with the filter feature. With future development, the app could also connect to a database where HR would be able to keep and update employee information. Further filter development would include sorting from Z-A, and creating more fields to filter by, including start date to keep track of upcoming work anniversaries.

## Credits

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).
